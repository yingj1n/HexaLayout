### Abstract
In this work, we attempt to solve a novel problem of estimating the surrounding bird eye layout of a complex driving scenario with six different camera perspective images only. While existing literature aims to approach this set of problem with a pre-trained neural network with ability todetect object given images, and rely on intrinsic and extrinsic calibration data to transform from perspective view(s) to bird eye view (BEV), we followed the idea from MonoLayout (Mani et al., 2020) to derive a single model that transform from perspective view to BEV and segments objects all-in-one. We also propose an architecture using both ResNet (He et al., 2015) and U-Net (Ron-neberger et al., 2015) that outperforms the Mono-Layout architecture.

### Usage 
Our implementation does not rely on any pre-trained networks, rather it is all built from scratch. The original dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wXQmPyoEGkHB8Jq2uZ2uSZa7TgLhw3Mb).
